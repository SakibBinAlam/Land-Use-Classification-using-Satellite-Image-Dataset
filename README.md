# Land-Use-Classification-using-Satellite-Image-Dataset <br>
This project is a part of "AT82.03 Machine Learning" course in Fall 2022 semester. <br>

Our study focus on LULC classification by: <br>
- Training, custom-built CNNs from scratch <br>
- Applying  transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained networks such as AlexNet and ResNet for LULC classification <br>
