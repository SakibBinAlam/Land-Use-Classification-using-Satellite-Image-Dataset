# Land-Use-Classification-using-Satellite-Image-Dataset <br>
This project is a part of "AT82.03 Machine Learning" course in Fall 2022 semester. <br>

Our study focuses on Land Use Classification by: <br>
- Training, custom-built CNNs from scratch <br>
- Applying  transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained networks such as AlexNet and ResNet for Land Use Classification <br>
- Extensive analysis, such as, number of misclassified images per label, prediction accuracy per label, showing misclassified images for each label, etc.

This repository contains the part of CNN implementation. Transfer learning implementation for our project is done in this <a href="https://github.com/tisserapac/ML_Project_2022">repository</a>
