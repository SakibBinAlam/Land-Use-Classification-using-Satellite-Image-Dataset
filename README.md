# Enhancing land use and land cover classification through comparative analysis of deep learning architectures <br>
This mansucript is curreenlty under review in the journal Ecological Informatics. <br>

Our study focuses on Land Use Classification by: <br>
- Training, custom-built CNNs from scratch <br>
- Applying  transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained networks such as AlexNet and ResNet for Land Use Classification <br>
- Extensive analysis, such as, number of misclassified images per label, prediction accuracy per label, showing misclassified images for each label, etc.

This repository contains the part of CNN implementation. Transfer learning implementation for our project is not uploaded yet.
